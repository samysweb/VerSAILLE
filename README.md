Welcome to the teaching materials repository for VerSAILLE and Mosaic.
This repository is meant to provide resources for learning about [VerSAILLE & Mosaic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10998) --- a combination of techniques that admits using the rigorous mathematical foundations of [differential dynamic logic](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-63588-0) ($d\mathcal{L}$) to reason about neural network control systems.

Let us start with some terminology:
- **VerSAILLE** is the theoretical framework that helps us to come up with correct-by-construction verification properties for Neural Networks deployed in control systems.
- **Mosaic** is an abstract framework for lifting off-the-shelf Open-Loop Neural Network Verification Tools to the task of verifying polynomial arithmetic specifications of arbitrary propositional structure. The framework preserves a verifier's completeness.
- $\mathbf{N^3V}$ is a concrete implementation of the Mosaic framework for $\mathrm{ReLU}$ neural networks and internally uses [nnenum](https://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum/).

## Getting Started
1. Please follow the [installation instructions](INSTALLATION.md)
2. After starting the container (see installation instruction), open the following link in your browser:  
   [http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=versaille](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=versaille)
3. This should open a Jupyter Notebook Instance where [Intro.ipynb](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/Training.ipynb?token=versaille) tells you about the next steps.

**Note on files in Docker Container:**  
By default, Docker will create a *volume*, i.e. a persistent storage, on your computer which will store all data contained in your Jupyter Lab working directory (`/data`).
- To copy data from the docker container to your computer use the following instructions:  
  ```bash
  > CID=$(docker run -d -p 8888:8888 samweb/versaille)
  docker cp $CID:/data/<File I want to copy> ./<where I want to copy it to>
  ```
- To change this default behavior, you can use [mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/)
