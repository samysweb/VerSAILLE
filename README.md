# VerSAILLE & Mosaic
Welcome to the teaching materials repository for VerSAILLE and Mosaic.
This repository is meant to provide resources for learning about [VerSAILLE & Mosaic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10998) --- a combination of techniques that admits using the rigorous mathematical foundations of [differential dynamic logic](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-63588-0) ($d\mathcal{L}$) to reason about neural network control systems.

## Getting Started
1. Please follow the [installation instructions](INSTALLATION.md)
